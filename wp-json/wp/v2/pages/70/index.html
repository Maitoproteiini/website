There\u2019s a constant rat race to grab our attention. In online political discourse, this means an arms race of more and more radical and idiotic takes by pundits. I\u2019m not immune, but I can be a part of the radical non-proliferation act. This is done by striving for humility and backing up all descriptive statements with a source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why these essays won\u2019t promise to fix the world or even claim to fully understand its problems. These writings are for the layman to understand my thinking on politics and hopefully get a morsel of truth that helps us unbind from the online political chaos we find ourselves in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[1]     Philosophyinsights (2017, November 12).
